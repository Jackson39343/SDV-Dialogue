# SDV-Dialogue
A mod that'll change some of the dialogue in Stardew Valley. Created for part of a folio. 

Tips about the game will be delivered through some dialogue dependent on your relationship with various characters, alongside occasional gifts.
The aim of these additions is to provide players with a more practical reason for befriending the villagers, while remaining true to the lore and style of the game.
